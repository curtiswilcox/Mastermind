## Game Description
Based off of the old board game. The user enters a number, which generates a hidden code comprised of that many colors (ROY G BIV + black/white), where duplicates are allowed. The user then has 12 attempts to guess what the code is. 

### Possible Responses
* \- => the guess was completely wrong; 
* 0 => the color is correct, but it is in the wrong place; 
* 1 => the color is correct and is in the right place.
