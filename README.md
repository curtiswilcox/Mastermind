## Game Description
Based off of the old board game. There is a hidden code comprised of a number (based off of the user's decision) of colors (ROY G BIV + black/white). The user can then guess what the code is. 

### Possible Responses
* -- => the guess was completely wrong; 
* 0 => the color is correct, but it is in the wrong place; 
* 1 => the color is correct and is in the right place.
