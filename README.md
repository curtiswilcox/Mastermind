## Game Description
Based off of the old board game. There is a hidden code comprised of a number (based off of the user's decision) of colors (ROY G BIV + black/white). The user can then guess what the code is. '--' means that their guess was completely wrong. '0' means that the color is correct, but it is in the wrong place. '1' means that the color is correct and is in the right place.
